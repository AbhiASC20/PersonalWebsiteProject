## Instructions
1. Part of becoming a marketable developer is knowing how to show off your work and making it easy for people to find you. You should keep a regularly updated personal portfolio website, which you’ll start building today!
2. Just as you did with the Super Stellar website, take ~ 5 minutes to [research what makes a great personal website](https://business.tutsplus.com/series/how-to-make-a-great-personal-resume-website-ultimate-guide--cms-1129). 
3. Build out your wireframes (desktop and mobile). 
   - You do not need to make a single page site! Feel free to have your content in separate files and have links to them on your homepage.
   - Your website should have:
     - A short bio of who you are (“About”)
     - Your skills and expertise (not just related to coding!)
     - A portfolio of your work with at least three previous projects you’ve made during the SI (GitHub repos and/or hosted sites)
       - Include an image, title, and description for each
     - Anything else you want to put!
   - This is a work in progress, and it's okay if you don't have a lot to talk about right now. 
   - **This is a perfect place to TELL YOUR STORY!**
     - **Where are you from?**
     - **What do you enjoy doing? Why do you enjoy it?**
     - **What’s your family like? What was life like growing up? What have you been through?**
     - **What do you want to do or where do you want to go in the near future? In the distant future? Why?**
   - Consider what cool designs, colors, images and other elements resonate with you how you might include them in your website.
   - You do NOT need your instructor's approval here, however, it’s beneficial to you to ask for their advice and input.
4. Once you feel comfortable with your wireframes, use command line to create a new project folder called “personalSite”
   - Navigate into the folder and create your “index.html” file and the remaining filesystem.
5. Keep in mind:
   - Use real content, not placeholder content!
     - It’s OK to use placeholders to get started, but remember to replace it with real information afterwards
   - The website should be properly hosted on GitHub
   - The website should be responsive and work well on a mobile device.
     - The target device is iPhone5 (320x568)
     - Make sure to test your website for smaller devices using Chrome Dev Tools (`Ctrl + Shift + I`)
6. **This is a MILESTONE project
This project will NOT be graded. It is simply used to gauge how our students are doing during the SI. Check out [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YgQJQB8fp1DRq0rRnclTadTQDDb6Ac1SovMfvLcGMfU/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.**
7. Have fun making your site!

## Extra Credit
- You don't want people leaving your site. Make your links open in a new window.
- Many of the p5 projects we made were not properly hosted. However, if you have GitHub host them, you can send users to them directly to play and interact with.
